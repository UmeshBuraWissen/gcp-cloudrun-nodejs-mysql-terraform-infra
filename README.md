Section 1:
Pre-requiest steps for creating service account for first time in local machine:
step 1: configure the google cloud authentication using gcloud auth login command
step 2: set the Azuredevops personal access token
eg: for windows run : SET AZDO_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="Pass_ZDO_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
                      SET AZDO_ORG_SERVICE_URL="Pass_AZDO_ORG_SERVICE_URL"
step 3: run the terraform init command locally to initizalation and backend configration
step 4: run the terraform plan command locally to see the resource provisioning details
step 5: run the terraform apply command locally to provisioning the resource


Section 2:
step 1: Currently we are building and deploying nodejs application using docker file and pushing the image to google container registery.

step 2: provisiong cloud infra structure such as gcp project, vpc, subnet, dns, firewall, cloud run, cloud sql(MySql), vpc connector, container registery, secret manager, service account using IAC Terraform

step 3: Infrastructe provisiong using terraform is depolyed using  AzureDevops pipeline and application deployment of nodejs is deployed using AzureDevops pipeline
i.  Add the serviceaccount(serviceconnectionsrv) json key file content in infra pipeline variable variable name as "GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS"
ii. Add the infra pipeline variable  "TF_VAR_project_id" and replace the value with project_id 

step 4: Infrastructe provisiong using terraform is depolyed using GCP CloudBuild pipeline and application deployment of nodejs is deployed using GCP CloudBuild pipeline

step 5: Infrastructe provisiong using terraform is depolyed using Jenkins Pipelines(JPAC/Groovy Scripts) and application deployment of nodejs is deployed using Jenkins Pipelines(JPAC/Groovy Scripts) 
i. Make sure that terraform, docker and python(pip) installed on the jenkins server
ii. Add the serviceaccount(serviceconnectionsrv) json key file in jenkins credentials name as "gcp-service-account-key"
iii. Add the git credentails username and password in the jenkins credentials

step 6: Infrastructe provisiong using terraform is depolyed using GithubActions and application deployment of nodejs is deployed using GithubActions
i. Add the serviceaccount(serviceconnectionsrv) json key file content in secret variable name as "GCP_SA_KEY"

step 7: Infrastructe provisiong using terraform is depolyed using GitLab and application deployment of nodejs is deployed using GitLab
i. Add the serviceaccount(serviceconnectionsrv) json key file content in secret variable name as "GCP_SA_KEY"
